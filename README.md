# DISCLAIMER
This is a very work in progress utility. However, I have big plans for this.

Stay tuned.

# PyPack
PyPack is an extension to Datapacks and Resourcepacks which effectively merges Mcfunction and Python.

All documentation can be found [here](link soon).

# Usage
Run `PyPack.py` in the directory of the Datapack or Resourcepack, and it will automatically replace all PyPack code with code Minecraft understands.

# Features
- [F-Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals)
- Inline Pythonic code
