# PyPack
PyPack is an extension to Datapacks and Resourcepacks which effectively merges Mcfunction and Python.

All documentation can be found [here](link soon).

# Usage
Run `PyPack.py` in the directory of the Datapack or Resourcepack, and it will automatically replace all PyPack code with code Minecraft understands.
